**âœ… This repository contains my Final Project to finish the course "ROS Basics in 5 Days (Python)".
In this project I had to control a TurtleBot robot in order to perform specific movements.**

PD: You will probably need more than 5 days to finish it ðŸ˜†

## ðŸ”° WHAT IS #ROS ?

ROS is an advanced open-source tool for building Robot Applications. You can use it to control Robots in Simulators or even in Reality. You can choose between #C++ and #Python to program in ROS.

The main problem of #ROS is the complexity of learning at the beginning, that's why I took this course.

Nowdays, many companies and researchers use this tool thanks to its compatibility, the low resources it needs and the thousands of plugings available.

In my future projects I intend to combine #AI and #ROS.
